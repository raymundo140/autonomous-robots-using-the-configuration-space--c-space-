# autonomous robots using the configuration space (c-space)
This repository contains a Python project that calculates and visualizes the configuration space (C-Space) of a 3-DOF planar robot by generating a grid of angles in the range of $[-\pi, \pi]$ and detecting collisions with obstacles. Additionally, the A* algorithm is implemented to plan collision-free paths, and matplotlib is used to smoothly animate the robot's movement along the planned route.
